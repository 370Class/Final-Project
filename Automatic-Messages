*Write ideas about how the automatization will work for OpenMRS users(doctors, labs, pharmacy), write your name next to it.

Last Tuesday, Professor made it sound like sending automated messages via text message would be really complicate. I haven't fully explored it yet, but there appears to be an existing module for sending messages:

To send an SMS message, use the following code:
Context.getService(MessagingService.class).sendMessage("Hello, world!", "+18007654321", SMSProtocol.class);
This sends the message "Hello, world!" to the number 18007654321 via SMS. If the supplied phone number or message are badly formatted, an exception will be thrown.

Messages can be sent to patients from an android device, as described here:

Also, we could just use email. That would allow messages to be sent without needing a carrier.
